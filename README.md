# i-spy-with-pi
A computer vision project for raspberry pi

This project uses a USB Camera in the Raspberry Pi to capture video. Based on a specific gesture of the user, the system will
click a photo on the USB camera. This photo will then be saved to a separate folder outside the project. 

To make things interesting, we'll use a set of LEDs that will light up at different times of processing. 

Green - System active,
Red - Don't move, processing in progress
