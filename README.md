# i-spy-with-pi
A computer vision project for raspberry pi

This project uses a USB Camera in the Raspberry Pi to capture video. Based on a specific gesture of the user, the system will
click a photo on the USB camera. This photo will then be saved to a separate folder outside the project. 

And, 
we are going to use Diffusion Models!!!!
